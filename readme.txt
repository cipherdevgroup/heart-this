Add a simple heart button to let people tell you they love your WordPress content.

== Description ==

HeartThis adds a minimalistic "heart" button to let your visitors tell you when they really enjoy your content. It works similar to the way hearts on Twitter or Likes on Facebook work.

When a user clicks the heart button, their vote is counted and displayed as a single heart. HeartThis comes with a built-in popular posts widget that sorts posts based on the number of hearts they have. You can also use the saved "hearts" information in your own custom themes and plugins however you like.

HeartThis has the ability to automatically display hearts at the bottom of any post type, which can be selected from the options screen inside the WordPress admin dashboard. If you'd like more control over where and how your hearts display, you can also use the `[heart_this]` shortcode or `heart_this_hearts()` template tag to display them inside your content or theme.
